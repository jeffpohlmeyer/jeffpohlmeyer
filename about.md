# About Me

Hi, I'm Jeff Pohlmeyer â€” a front-endâ€“oriented full-stack engineer with a nonlinear path into tech, a background in applied mathematics, and a deep love for building intuitive, performant web applications.

## ðŸ§  My Professional Journey

### Academia & Actuarial Science

I started my academic career at [Loyola](https://www.loyola.edu), double majoring in Math and French, and spent a formative year abroad in France. I went on to earn a Masterâ€™s degree at [Montclair State](https://www.montclair.edu/mathematics/) and then a PhD in Applied Mathematics at [NJIT](https://math.njit.edu/), where I researched tissue engineering and mathematical biology. During that time, I also had the opportunity to study at [Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) through a visiting studentship.

As I was completing my PhD, I took a course in stochastic calculus that sparked an interest in quantitative finance. That led me toward actuarial science, where I earned my ASA (Associate of the Society of Actuaries) and worked in pricing, validation, and risk modeling roles at [New York Life](https://www.newyorklife.com/), [MetLife](https://www.metlife.com/), and [A.M. Best](https://web.ambest.com/).

While I enjoyed the modeling aspects of actuarial work, I realized that what I was truly drawn to was the building: creating systems and tools that solved real problems. That realization nudged me toward software development.

### Discovering Engineering

At A.M. Best, I transitioned from actuarial modeling into building a full-stack web application from scratch. I started with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and fell in love. I led the development of a platform that replaced a suite of Excel-based models with a unified, interactive web experience built with **Vue 2** on the frontend and **Django REST Framework** on the backend.

That project ignited my passion for web development â€” not just coding, but solving problems holistically: working with users, designing interfaces, structuring data flow, and collaborating across disciplines.

### Engineering Roles & Growth

From there, I joined [Urbint](https://www.urbint.com/) as a backend engineer, contributing to FastAPI and GraphQL services in a high-pressure pre-release product. It wasnâ€™t the most nurturing environment, but it reaffirmed my appreciation for good frontend architecture â€” something I had less opportunity to touch in that role.

I later joined [Arqu](https://arqu.com/) as their first dedicated frontend engineer. The frontend codebase had been built by backend engineers and needed a serious overhaul. Over time, I led a transformation of the UI stack:

* Rebuilt in **Vue 3** using **Pinia**, **TypeScript**, and **ES modules**
* Replaced **Vuetify** with **shadcn-vue** and headless UI components for greater flexibility
* Introduced rigorous testing (Vitest, Cypress) and CI (GitHub Actions, ESLint/Prettier)
* Worked directly with stakeholders to define features, scope tasks, and manage delivery

Iâ€™ve worn many hats â€” designer, PM, support â€” and genuinely enjoy being a bridge between business goals and the user experience.

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

I'm happiest when Iâ€™m solving problems that matter to people â€” and doing so with empathy, clarity, and clean code. I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, well-organized state management, and choosing the right tool for the job.

Whether Iâ€™m coding a component, designing a UI flow, or writing docs, I care deeply about user experience, developer ergonomics, and long-term maintainability.
