# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeff Pohlmeyer

I'm a front-end–oriented full-stack engineer who builds accessible, fast, and pragmatic web applications.

Currently, I lead the UI architecture at [arqu](https://arqu.com), where I’ve helped shape a more scalable and maintainable frontend by modernizing legacy Vue code into a clean, idiomatic Vue 3 application using Pinia, TypeScript, and custom-designed component systems. I regularly collaborate with stakeholders across product, operations, and design to ensure our solutions not only meet technical standards but also align with user needs and business goals.
